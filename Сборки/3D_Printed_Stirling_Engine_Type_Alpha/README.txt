My version of 3D printable Stirling engine. You can see a bit of the process of assembly and operation of the engine here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kttaajHHPeY

Check my I3 Mega **ULTIMATE upgrade guide!** There is a lot of knowledge which may help You get the best 3D printing results. You will find it here: http://bit.ly/2OVbu5Z

Tips:
- Make sure that Your printer is calibrated well before printing. 
- Do not fix syringes too tight because glass will bend a little and it will create a lot of friction inside.
- Pistons must be polished with fine sandpaper to move freely inside cylinders, but without losing too much pressure.
- Angle between the cranks must be 90 degrees.

Part list:
- 12 x M8 Nut
- 12 x M3x10 Screw
- 18 x M3 Nut
- 2 x M3 self-locking nut
- 8 x M3x14 Screw
- 4 x M3 Washer
- 6 x M4 Washer
- 4 x M4 Nut
- 1 x M4 at least 44mm long screw with countersunk head. You need to cut it to right lenght.
- 2 x 604ZZ bearing: http://bit.ly/2JMp75J
- 4 x 683ZZ bearing: http://bit.ly/2qwAiHr
- 2 x 10 ml glass syringe: http://bit.ly/2p2ebJl
- Heat resistant tubing to connect the syringes.

Printing part list:
- 2 x connecting_rod
- 2 x flywheel_support
- 2 x piston_mount_part_1.stl
- 2 x piston_mount_part_2.stl
Every other part needs to be printed once.

# Print Settings

Printer: ANET A6
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2 mm
Infill: 30% or more

Notes: 
I have printed it with PLA but the base was not stiff enough. STL files have been fixed a bit to help with that, but printing the base with ABS may be a good idea.
